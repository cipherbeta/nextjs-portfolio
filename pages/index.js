                    <p>
                        I'm a self-taught front end web developer. Semantic HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, ES6+ JS for my core with
                        a focus on ReactJS development. Looking to learn fullstack dev soon!

                    <h1>Music Production</h1>
                    <p>
                        On a whim a few years back, I picked up FL Studio during a sale. That was a mistake.
                        I've ended up spending a lot of time in there making various small tracks and recordings.
                        While I'm not a great producer, I can make some decent tracks in a cinch if needed.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Video Production</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have a good amount of experience editing and assembling videos in Premiere Pro, as well
                        as experience inside Adobe Audition and FL Studio for mastering audio for videos. It's something
                        I enjoy doing every once in a while. Eventually when I get off my lazy arse I want to start a YT channel.
